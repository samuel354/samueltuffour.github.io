          <h3>Data Analytics & AI Foundations</h3>
          <p>
            In my research, I’m diving deep into data analytics using Python, R,
            and SAS, where I focus on learning how to clean, visualize, and
            interpret data in ways that reveal insights that often go unnoticed
            at first glance. Beyond simply analyzing numbers, I am exploring
            statistical modeling techniques and predictive algorithms that can
            forecast trends in real-world applications like healthcare,
            business, and finance. This is also forming my foundation for more
            advanced machine learning work, including neural networks,
            time-series forecasting, and reinforcement learning. My goal is not
            just to understand data but to use it to create smarter, automated
            decision-making systems. These ongoing explorations are preparing me
            to branch into specialized AI areas, where I’ll connect analytics to
            impactful, scalable solutions.

          <h3>Application / Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            I actively build both desktop and web applications, blending design,
            logic, and functionality. On the desktop side, I’ve created
            interactive tools with PyQt5 that streamline workflows and improve
            user experiences. On the web side, I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            Django, and sometimes React to design responsive platforms that
            bring ideas to life. Recently, I’ve worked on database-driven
            systems that handle large-scale data efficiently, focusing on speed
            and scalability. My projects also include integrating APIs, building
            real-time features, and experimenting with cloud deployments. I
            enjoy tackling full-stack challenges, from backend optimization and
            server management to frontend design that feels smooth and
            intuitive. Each project strengthens my ability to merge creativity
            with technical rigor while delivering solutions that are practical
            and impactful. lorem100

          <h3>Emerging Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            Recently, I’ve been exploring emerging technologies like cloud
            computing, distributed databases, and scalable serverless systems,
            which form the backbone of modern software. These technologies are
            especially exciting because they directly support how applications
            handle millions of users and vast datasets in real-time. I’ve been
            studying how cloud infrastructures such as AWS and Google Cloud can
            be optimized for analytics, AI, and web applications. Another area
            I’m passionate about is understanding how edge computing and
            containerized services improve performance and reliability. My
            current experiments involve linking these technologies to AI models,
            so that analytics can run faster, adapt more intelligently, and
            provide insights at scale. Exploring this space is shaping my vision
            of building systems that are not only technically advanced but also
            efficient, accessible, and globally impactful.
